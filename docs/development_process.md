# Development Process

This document explains the complete development process of the Number Guessing Game, including coding, testing, Git usage, and GitHub hosting.

## 1. Planning the Game Logic
Before writing code, the main structure of the game was planned:
1. Generate a random number  
2. Ask the user to guess  
3. Compare guess with the real number  
4. Give hints ("too high" or "too low")  
5. Limit total attempts  
6. Display results

## 2. Writing Code in Visual Studio Code
- Created a new project folder and opened it in **VS Code**  
- Created a file named `main.py`  
- Wrote the full game logic  
- Used the **integrated terminal** to test the program:
  ```bash
  python main.py
